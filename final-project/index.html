    <div class="home-paragraph-1">

    <p>Facility or facilities management (FM) is a profession dedicated to supporting people.
    It ensures the functionality, comfort, safety, sustainability and efficiency of the built environment
    - the buildings we live and work in and their surrounding infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p><strong>"Facility Management is an organizational function which integrates people,
    place and process within the built environment with the purpose of improving the quality of life of people
    and the productivity of the core business".</strong>
    </p>

    <p>This combination of job responsibilities supports the operations of each organization to create an
      environment where the systems work together seamlessly, from the parking lot to the executive suite.
      Facility managers are the people who make sure we have the safest and best experience possible,
      by coordinating the processes that make the built environment succeed.

        play and live are safe, comfortable, sustainable and efficient.
